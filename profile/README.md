# ODY framework
A framework that leverages many of the awesome things Swoole delivers.
This started as a case study on how PHP frameworks are built and quickly turned into a sort of passion project that has taught me many things.

What is ODY? A super lightweight PHP framework aimed towards API development and microservices. There isn't much fluff, choose what you need 
and implement it as you see fit. 

Not (yet) for production use. ODY is under active development, the bare basics are functional and stable, and more components will be added as time goes on.
