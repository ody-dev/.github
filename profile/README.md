# ODY framework
ODY is a lightweight PHP coroutine framework designed for API development and microservices, built on top of Swooleâ€™s powerful asynchronous capabilities. It keeps things minimal, allowing you to pick only what you need and integrate it your way.

Originally started as a case study on PHP framework architecture, ODY quickly evolved into a passion project that has taught me many things and made me a way better developer.


> [!WARNING]
> ðŸš§ Not production-ready (yet). ODY is actively being developed. While the core functionality is stable, additional components and features are continuously being added.
