# ODY framework

(ðŸš€ Swoole-Powered, Async-First)

ODY is a lightweight high-performance asynchronous PHP framework designed for building microservices and RESTful APIs with ease. Built on top of Swoole, ODY leverages asynchronous processing and coroutines to deliver exceptional performance while maintaining a clean, developer-friendly architecture.

**Warning:**  
ðŸ”¥ *"After using ODY, going back to Laravel feels like driving a tractor on the Autobahn."*  
*(Yes, itâ€™s that fast. No, itâ€™s not production-ready yetâ€”but youâ€™ll wish it was.)*

Current benchmarks: **33120 requests/sec**
```bash
Running 30s test @ http://localhost:9501/users/1
  12 threads and 200 connections
  Thread Stats   Avg      Stdev     Max   +/- Stdev
    Latency     5.97ms    3.60ms  71.90ms   74.11%
    Req/Sec     2.78k   330.18    12.85k    80.15%
  996776 requests in 30.10s
Requests/sec:  33120.42
```

## Key Features

- **High Performance**: Built with Swoole support for asynchronous processing and coroutines
- **PSR Compliance**: Implements PSR-7, PSR-15, and PSR-17 for HTTP messaging and middleware
- **Modular Design**: Build and integrate different modules
