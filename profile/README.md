# ODY framework

(üöÄ Swoole-Powered, Async-First, and Laravel-Simple)

ODY is a lightweight high-performance asynchronous PHP framework designed for building microservices and RESTful APIs with ease. Built on top of Swoole, ODY leverages asynchronous processing and coroutines to deliver exceptional performance while maintaining a clean, developer-friendly architecture.

**Warning:**  
üî• *"After using ODY, going back to Laravel feels like driving a tractor on the Autobahn."*  
*(Yes, it‚Äôs that fast. No, it‚Äôs not production-ready yet‚Äîbut you‚Äôll wish it was.)*

## **Why ODY Exists**
Laravel is **slow**. Node.js is **a mess**. Traditional PHP blocks like it‚Äôs 2004.

- **Node.js-like speed** (thanks to Swoole‚Äôs coroutines).
- **Laravel-like elegance** (PSR standards, clean APIs).
- **Zero JavaScript tax** (real-time apps without Node.js/Redis/Echo/npm modules bloat nonsense).

## üöÄ Key Features

- **High Performance**: Built with Swoole support for asynchronous processing and coroutines
- **PSR Compliance**: Implements PSR-7, PSR-15, and PSR-17 for HTTP messaging and middleware
- **Modular Design**: Build and integrate different modules
- **Middleware System**: Middleware system for request/response processing
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in IoC container for dependency management
- **Console Support**: CLI commands for various tasks and application management
- **Routing**: Simple and flexible routing system with support for route groups and middleware

| **Feature**       | **ODY**                          | **Laravel**                     | **Node.js**               |  
|-------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|  
| **WebSockets**    | Native PHP, 5-minute setup       | Requires Node.js + Echo + Redis | Native (but JavaScript üò©)|  
| **Async Tasks**   | Built-in, no queue workers       | Needs Redis + `supervisorctl`   | Callback hell             |  
| **Concurrency**   | 8K+ req/sec on a $5 VM         | 500 req/sec (if lucky)          | Fast but chaotic          |  
| **CQRS**         | Async/sync, 5-line config       | DIY + AMQP + pain               | ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è                      |  

## **üì¶ Batteries Included (But Modular)**
Need more? ODY ships with **13+ modules**:
- **Database:** Eloquent, Doctrine, or raw DBAL (your choice).
- **Real-Time:** WebSockets, task manager, process pooling.
- **DevOps:** InfluxDB metrics, connection pooling, caching.
- **Auth:** JWT/OAuth2 out of the box.

*No bloat. Swap anything.*

## **ü§î "But Is It Production-Ready?"**
‚úÖ *"We‚Äôre almost in beta‚Äîbut here‚Äôs what‚Äôs already working:"*
- [x] A solid foundation
- [x] Truly modular design with nex to no dependencies
- [X] WebSockets
- [X] Async CQRS
- [x] AMQP support
- [x] conenction pooling
- [X] 8K RPS benchmarks on lightweight machines 

**Dare to try it?**
```bash
composer create-project ody/framework ody && cd ody && php ody server:start  
```
