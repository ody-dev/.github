# ODY framework

(ðŸš€ Swoole-Powered, Async-First)

ODY is a lightweight high-performance asynchronous PHP framework designed for building microservices and RESTful APIs with ease. Built on top of Swoole, ODY leverages asynchronous processing and coroutines to deliver exceptional performance while maintaining a clean, developer-friendly architecture.

**Warning:**  
ðŸ”¥ *"After using ODY, going back to Laravel feels like driving a tractor on the Autobahn."*  
*(Yes, itâ€™s that fast. No, itâ€™s not production-ready yetâ€”but youâ€™ll wish it was.)*

Current benchmarks: **25545.05 requests/sec**
```bash
wrk -t12 -c200 -d30s http://localhost:9501/users/1
Running 30s test @ http://localhost:9501/users/1
